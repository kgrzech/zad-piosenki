On one lonely night <br>
Drenched in rain<br>
Oh what can I see?<br>
And you wander about<br>
Feel the pain<br>
You know how far we came from home?<br>
<br>
Who’ll let you know<br>
If I’m safe<br>
It’s not what I see<br>
I have never heard life’s always hard<br>
Go wrong, it’s alright<br>
<br>
Don’t be shy whenever you want something<br>
What you waiting for?<br>
Find your door<br>
Gotta hold your own and stay don’t run away<br>
When you show (will to live there’s no way you)<br>
Will lose it after finding that “anything”<br>
Cuz life is full of points you score<br>
You’ll see, brighter days coming<br>
All the nights becoming day<br>
On your mark!!<br>
<br>
One place to be?<br>
Where are we?<br>
Not what it seems for sure<br>
Coming up, bring it up<br>
Let your mind set you free<br>
Hold up! Here that noise?<br>
You know, they are breaking<br>
What we built<br>
I’ve never seen<br>
I’ve never thought it would come<br>
It’s alright<br>
<br>
Don’t be shy whenever you want something<br>
What you waiting for?<br>
Find you door<br>
Gotta hold your own and stay don’t run away<br>
When you show (will to live there’s no way you)<br>
Will lose it after finding that “anything”<br>
Cuz life is full of points you score<br>
You’ll see, brighter days coming<br>
All the nights becoming day<br>
On your mark!!<br>
<br>
Gosh!<br>
Pushing too rough!<br>
Packing to punch!<br>
It’s just too much!<br>
Heading to ditch!<br>
Ignoring your wish!<br>
Much time to miss!!<br>
But I can’t reach!!!<br>
<br>
No matter how much you try to live good<br>
No matter what you get for the answer<br>
No matter where you roam for the reason<br>
You elation is high<br>
<br>
Don’t be shy whenever you want something<br>
What you waiting for?<br>
Find you door<br>
Gotta hold your own and stay don’t run away<br>
When you show (will to live there’s no way you)<br>
Will lose it after finding that “anything”<br>
Cuz life is full of points you score<br>
You’ll see, brighter days coming<br>
All the nights becoming day<br>
On your mark!!<br>
